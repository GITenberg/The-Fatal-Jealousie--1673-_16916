None of Henry Nevil Payne's plays, <i>The Fatal Jealousie</i>
(1673), <i>The Morning Ramble</i> (1673), <i>The Siege of
Constantinople</i>
(1675), bears his name on the title-page. Plenty of
external evidence exists, however, to prove his claim to them.
John Downes, in <i>Roscius Anglicanus</i> (1708), has this to say:
"<i>Loves Jealousy</i> [i.e. <i>The Fatal Jealousy</i>], and <i>The Morning
Ramble</i>. Written by Mr. <i>Nevil Pain</i>. Both were very well
<i>Acted</i>,
but after their first run, were laid aside, to make Room
for others; the Company having then plenty of new Poets" (ed.
Montague Summers, London, n.d., pp. 33-34). "After the Tempest,
came the Siege of <i>Constantinople</i>, Wrote by Mr. <i>Nevill
Pain</i>" (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 35). Langbaine's <i>An Account of the English
Dramatick Poets</i> (1691) gives no author for <i>The Siege of
Constantinople</i>,
but says of <i>The Fatal Jealousy</i> that it is "ascribed
by some to Mr. Pane" (p. 531) and of <i>The Morning Ramble</i>
that this "Play is said to be written by One Mr. <i>Pane</i>, and may
be accounted a good Comedy" (p. 541).</p>

<p class = "intro">
We do not have to depend on the early historians of the
English drama for certain knowledge that Payne was for a time
a dramatist. Though his brief excursion into the theater must
later have seemed to him a minor episode in his life, Payne's
enemies were aware of the fact that he was a playwright and
have written their knowledge into the record of his treasonable
activities. For example, the author of a burlesque life
of Payne, which contains, so far as I know, the only connected
account of his activities, makes this useful remark: "Then
[after his return from Ireland in 1672] he composes a Tragedy
of a certain Emperour of Constantinople, whom he never knew;
but in whose person he vilifies a certain Prince [Charles II],
whom he very well knows" (<i>Modesty Triumphing over Impudence</i> ...
1680, pp. 18-19).</p>

<p class = "intro">
As an agent of the Catholic party, Payne had excellent
reasons for wishing to keep his affairs well veiled. What we
know of his life has had to be pieced together from information
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
found in state papers, court records, and "histories" of
the branches of the damnable Popish plots.<a href = "#note1"
name = "tag1">*</a> The date of his
birth is not known, nor of his death, unless Summers was correct
in giving it (without supporting evidence) as 1710 (<i>The
Works of Aphra Behn</i>, 1915, V, 519).</p>

<p class = "intro">
Payne's first opportunity to serve the Catholic party
came, apparently, in 1670, when he went to Ireland in the employ
of Sir Elisha Leighton, who was private secretary to the
new lord lieutenant, Lord Berkeley. By April 1672 Berkeley's
pro-Catholic rule had so alienated the city council of Dublin
that he was ordered to return to England and the Earl of Essex
was sent out in his place. From Essex we learn that Payne
was deeply involved in the machinations of Berkeley and that
he continued to stir up trouble in Ireland even after his return
to England.</p>

<p class = "intro">
Back in England, possibly by mid-May, 1672, Payne must
have plunged at once into work for the theater. <i>The Fatal
Jealousy</i> was performed at the Duke's Theatre in Dorset Garden
in August 1672 and <i>The Morning Ramble</i> was shown at the same
theater three months later. Both plays were performed before
the King (Allerdyce Nicoll, <i>A History of Restoration Drama</i>,
1923, p. 309). Payne's third and last play, <i>The Siege of
Constantinople</i>,
which reached the stage in November 1674, is of
particular interest in view of his long association with the
cause of James, Duke of York. Payne found his plot in the
<i>General Historie of the Turkes</i> by Knolles, but he altered
history to produce a work which would compliment James. It
is significant that there is no prototype in Knolles for Thomazo
(James), the brother of the last Christian emperor of Constantinople
(Charles). At the end of the play the Turks conquer
the city (<i>sc.</i>, the Dutch and London) and the Emperor is
slain. Here was a warning to Englishmen of what would happen
if their double-dealing "Lord Chancellor" (Shaftesbury)--the
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
villain of the piece--were to succeed in alienating the two
royal brothers.</p>

<p class = "intro">
During the years 1678-1680 Payne's name dodges in and
out of the thousands of words written about the Popish plot.
He was pretty certainly a friend of Edward Coleman (Secretary
to the Duchess of York) who was executed for treason in December,
1678. After a hearing before the Privy Council, Payne
was held over for trial and imprisoned in the King's Bench.
Confinement did not in the least hinder him from giving aid
to the Catholic party in organizing its counter-attack. According
to <i>Mr. Tho. Dangerfields Particular Narrative</i> (1679)
he was one of the chief devisers of the Presbyterian Plot and,
as "chief Pen-man" for the Catholics, the author of several
"scandalous books" about their enemies. Payne was again before
the Privy Council in November 1679, but eventually all
the principals in the Catholic plots to discredit the government
were released.</p>

<p class = "intro">
After the accession of James II Payne kept more respectable
company. References to him during these years say nothing
about any work for the theater, but his pen was still
busy--from 1685 to 1687 in the cause of religious toleration.
In 1685 the Duke of Buckingham published <i>A Short Discourse
upon the Reasonableness of Men's having a Religion or
Worship of God</i>. A portion of this pamphlet had been written
as a letter to Payne. When Buckingham's work brought on a
pamphlet war, Payne (together with William Penn) rushed to
his defence. The debate grew hotter when James made the
first Declaration of Indulgence in April 1687. Payne was
one of the chief controversialists in the war of words that
followed. Another literary friend of these years, and an extravagant
admirer of his devotion to the Stuarts, was Aphra
Behn. She dedicated her <i>Fair Jilt</i> to Payne in 1688 in terms
which suggest that he had favored her in tangible ways.</p>

<p class = "intro">
With the deposition of James, the years of Payne's greatest
activity begin. The story of his life for the next twelve
years is intricate and exciting, for he has now moved out of
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
the company of writers into the dark world of secret agents
and prison-guards. Though he was confined in the Fleet by
January 1688/89, Payne went boldly ahead with plans for what
would be the first Jacobite conspiracy, the Montgomery Plot.
By some means he contrived to escape to Scotland, where his
plans had, of course, more fertile soil in which to grow.
Once more in custody, he was moved from one prison to another,
but the Privy Council was incapable of persuading the
Scottish authorities to "put the rogue to it." As more and
more evidence came out showing how deeply involved Payne was
in the Montgomery Plot, the Scottish Privy Council finally
was prevailed upon to put Payne to the torture. On Dec. 10,
1690, he bore the pain of two hours under thumb and leg screws
with such fortitude that some of the Councilors were "brangled"
and believed that his denials must be the words of an honest
man. The Earl of Crawford, one of the witnesses to this, the
last occasion in Britain in which a political prisoner was
tortured, was so moved that he reported to the Earl of Melville
that such manly resolution could come only from a deep
religious fervor: "[Payne] did conceive he was acting a thing
not only generous towards his friends and accomplices, but
likewise so meritorious, that he would thereby save his soule,
and be canoniz'd among the saints" (<i>Letters ... to George Earl
of Melville</i>, Bannatyne Club, 1843, pp. 582-3).</p>

<p class = "intro">
For nearly eleven years more Payne was moved from one
Scottish prison to another, while the Scottish Privy Council
sought to turn him over to the English and the Privy Council
in London endeavored to force him to trial in Scotland. The
truth is that Jacobitism was so rife in high places that they
whose duty it would be to prosecute him feared what might
happen if he were brought to the bar.</p>

<p class = "intro">
Finally, in February 1700/01, Payne was released. He
made his way to the Stuart court at St. Germain, whose incorruptible
secret agent he had been for twelve years. It was
fitting that the last information we have of him during his
life is derived from his "Brief memorial by way of preface to
some proposals for your Majesty's service," a detailed letter
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
of advice instructing the exiled king how he might yet recapture
his throne (printed in <i>Original Papers; containing
the Secret History of Great Britain</i>, 1775, I, 602-5). When
last heard from, Payne had yet another conspiracy planned
and ripened, to submit to his sovereign's approval.</p>
<br>
<p class = "intro">
Payne's <i>Fatal Jealousy</i> has intrinsic merit. If he had
written more works for the theater, he might have been remembered
with Southerne and possibly with Otway. But for the
scholar this tragedy will be chiefly interesting for the
Shakespearean influences to be found in it. Evidently Payne
held Shakespeare in great reverence, and the result is that
<i>The Fatal Jealousy</i> is one of the earliest examples of the return
to the Shakespearean norm in tragedy after the interlude
of the heroic play. Payne ridicules the love and honor
theme in <i>The Morning Ramble</i> where he makes Rose say (p. 54):</p>

<p class = "block">
Love and Honour are the two great Wheels, on which all
business moves. The Tradesman cheats you upon his
Honour, and like a Lord swears by that, but that he
particularly loves you, you should not have it so. No
Tragedy, Comedy, Farse, Demi-Farse, or Song nowadayes,
but is full of Love and Honour: Your Coffee-drinking
Crop-ear'd Little Banded-Secretary, that pretends not
to know more of Honour than it's Name, will out of
abundance of Love be still sighing and groaning for
the Honour of the Nation.
</p>

<p class = "intro">
The speaker of the Epilogue to <i>The Fatal Jealousy</i> pointedly
reminds the audience that they have listened to a genuine
tragedy and not to an heroic play. Its author has not relied
on the "rules of art," but hopes he may have succeeded
by some "Trick of Nature."</p>

<p class = "intro">
Most obvious of the Shakespearean influences is the
jealousy theme in which Don Antonio is modelled on Othello,
Caelia on Desdemona, and Jasper on Iago. My colleague, Professor
E.L. Hubler, who has a vast deal of the Shakespearean
text in his memory, finds twenty-two possible echoes or
parallels. Of these we agree that at least fourteen are
certain. The influences strike in most impressively from
<i>Othello</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Much Ado</i>,
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and <i>The
Tempest</i>. Let me cite two or three unmistakable echoes. Jasper's
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
manner of arousing Antonio's jealousy (pp. 17-19) and
even his words recall Iago's mental torturing of the Moor in
<i>Othello</i>, III, 3. Throughout Gerardo's soliloquy on death,
at the opening of Act III, there is continuous reference to
Hamlet's "To be or not to be." The antecedent of "madness
methodiz'd" (p. 35) is easily spotted, as is the parallel between
Flora's dream (p. 63) which will not leave her head
and the song that will not go from Desdemona's mind. So far
as I can discover, the seekers for Shakespearean allusions
in seventeenth-century writing have not located this rich mine.</p>

<p class = "intro">
It is to be regretted that when <i>The Fatal Jealousy</i> came
to the stage the company had, as Downes says, "plenty of new
poets," and so the play was laid aside after the first run.
The performance must have been brilliant. The greatest of
Restoration stage villains, Sandford, played Jasper. The
parts of Caelia, Eugenia, and the Witch were taken by veteran
actors. "Mr. Nath. Leigh" made his second appearance on
the stage in this performance as Captain of the Watch. The
lecherous Nurse to Caelia was played by the famous Nokes whose
sobriquet of "Nurse Nokes" may have come to him with this rôle
rather than from the part he took, seven years later, in Otway's
<i>Caius Marius</i>.</p>

<p class = "intro">
The text of <i>The Fatal Jealousy</i> presents no special difficulties.
Such slight variations as I have found among the
eleven copies I have examined--chiefly dropped letters and
the imperfect impression of some words--can be accounted for
as accidents to be expected in the printing off of the sheets
of a single edition. There seems to be no significance in
the fact that the title-page in some copies shows an ornament
placed between the second rule and the word <i>London</i>.</p>

great Sovereign Wits, that have such sway,<br>
Without Controul to save, or damn a Play;<br>
That with a pish, my Anthony, or so,<br>
Can the best Rally&rsquo;d sence at once or&rsquo;e throw;<br>
And by this pow&rsquo;r, that none must question now,<br>
Have made the most Rebellious Writers bow,<br>
Our Author, here his low Submission brings,<br>
Begging your pass, calls you the Stages Kings;<br>
He sayes, nay, on a Play-Book, swears it too,<br>
Your pox uppo&rsquo;nt damn it, what&rsquo;s here to do?<br>
Your nods, your winks, nay, your least signs of Wit,<br>
Are truer Reason than e&rsquo;re Poet writ,<br>
And he observes do much more sway the Pit.<br>
For sitting there h&rsquo; has seen the lesser gang<br>
Of Callow Criticks down their heads to bang;<br>
Lending long Ears to all that you should say,<br>
So understand, yet never hear the Play:<br>
Then in the Tavern swear their time they&rsquo;ve lost,<br>
And Curse the Poet put e&rsquo;m to that cost.<br>
And if one would their just Exceptions know,<br>
They heard such, such, or such a one say so;<br>
And thus in time by your dislikes they rise,<br>
To be thought Judges, though indeed but spyes.<br>
This is not fair your Subjects to betray<br>
To those that strive to Rival you in sway;<br>
That will in time by your expence of wit,<br>
Usurp or&rsquo;e us, and your successors sit.<br>
These and some other dangers to remove,<br>
We beg that though this Play you disapprove,<br>
Say nothing of it here, and when you&rsquo;re gone,<br>
We give that leave you&rsquo;le take to cry it down;<br>
Thus you preserve your pow&rsquo;r, and we shall be<br>
From Fopps, and Demi-Criticks Censure free.<br>
<br>
Subdu&rsquo;d by force, we Tyrants thus obey,<br>
But Ladys, you like lawful Monarches sway,<br>
You Rule by Love, and Pardon faults with ease,<br>
In Subjects that do all they can to please.<br>
By faction they condemn, you by our Peers,<br>
And he is guilty sure such Trial fears:<br>
And though our Author pleads not guilty now.<br>
And to his Tryal stands, he hopes that you,<br>
Will not too strictly his accusers hear,<br>
For if this Play can draw from you a Tear,<br>
He&rsquo;l slight the Wits, Half-Wits, and Criticks too;<br>
And Judge his strength by his well pleasing you.</div>

you well may blame my conduct of that bus&rsquo;ness,<br>
Since it produc&rsquo;d such dismal Accidents,<br>
As my heart trembles but to think upon;<br>
Yet for <i>Don Lewis</i>&rsquo;s Innocence and mine,<br>
In the contrivance of that Fatal Meeting;<br>
I must for ever, during Life, be Champion.<br>
And, as he with his dying breath protested,<br>
He ne&rsquo;re meant wrong to you; so am I ready<br>
To dye a Martyr to my Innocence.</p>

<p><i>Anto.</i> Come, come, these are but wyles to Palliate things,<br>
Can you believe me stupid, or an Ass?<br>
To think my Wife should meet a Man i&rsquo; th&rsquo; Night;<br>
Nay, more; a Man that was my seeming Friend;<br>
Yet taken in at Window privately!<br>
Nay, which was most, stay with him two full hours,<br>
And in a Room made proper by a Bed,<br>
And yet not Cuckold me; the thing&rsquo;s too plain,<br>
I do not doubt the deed, which Iv&rsquo;e Reveng&rsquo;d<br>
In part, by killing him: No, I am mad,<br>
That you should think so meanly still of me,<br>
As to hope time may alter my belief;<br>
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>

Or else that you suspect my Truth, when I have sworn<br>
By all things sacred; nay upon my Honour<br>
(Which I am so Jealous of) that if you would<br>
Relate the truth of your so close amours,<br>
I from my memory would blot it all,<br>
And look on you at worst, but as the Widdow<br>
Of your dead Couzen <i>Lewis</i>.</p>

By giving no belief, either to Vows<br>
Or Actions that have spoke my Innocence:<br>
Reflect (my Lord) on the unwearied pains<br>
Iv&rsquo;e took to gain your pardon for his Death.<br>
Think with what patience I&rsquo;ve suffer&rsquo;d still<br>
Your often starts of Passion, which sometimes<br>
Have ne&rsquo;re produc&rsquo;d th&rsquo; effects of Cruelty.<br>
And without boast, my Lord, you well do know<br>
My Friends were much too strong for yours at Court,<br>
Then had I but made known your severe Carriage,<br>
Or suffer&rsquo;d your surprizal&mdash;&rsquo;tis too plain;<br>
Yoor Life had been a forfeit to the Law.<br>
And were I but the wanton Wife you think me,<br>
What wou&rsquo;d more welcome be then that Revenge&mdash;<br>
Here on my knees I beg again, my Lord,<br>
You would perswade your self, that what I told you<br>
Was cause of that close meeting, was so truly,<br>
And no invention; and as this Day<br>
Began our Nuptial Joys, so let it end<br>
Our Marriage Discords; then shall I have cause<br>
To keep it Annually a Festival;<br>

After his mortal Wound, for he Related<br>

Yet never told that Secret, only known<br>
On Earth, to him, to <i>Cælia</i> and my self.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Sir, <i>Don Antonio</i> likewise is return&rsquo;d.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> What reason had he for it, dost thou know?</p>

<p><i>Ser.</i> My Lord, I do not; for we by your appointment<br>
Having took Horse, did with our greatest speed<br>
Pursue the Road should lead us to <i>Don John</i>&rsquo;s;<br>
When near a Thicket stands some two Miles off,<br>
I spy&rsquo;d <i>Antonio</i> lying on the ground,<br>
And <i>Jasper</i> walking of the Horses by him,<br>
Fearing his seeing us, we took the Thicket,<br>
Where shelter&rsquo;d from their Eyes, I left my Fellows.<br>
But I approach&rsquo;d as near as possible,<br>
Hoping I did you Service, if I could<br>
By their Discourse gather their cause of stay.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> &rsquo;Twas like thy self, both diligent and prudent.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> But all my care did signifie but little,<br>
The Wind blew fresh, and rustling in the Wood,<br>
Wholly destroy&rsquo;d their Voyces, so that few words<br>
Of what they said I heard; and those I did,<br>
Came so divided they had no connexion.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<span class = "folionum">F2</span>
<i>Ger.</i> What sort of Actions did you then perceive?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> My Lord, I saw <i>Antonio</i> much disturb&rsquo;d;<br>
Sometimes he&rsquo;d rise and walk a turn or two<br>
With eager pace, then stop as suddenly,<br>
Then stamp and tear his hair; then loudly cry.<br>
She&rsquo;s dead, she&rsquo;s dead! Oh, <i>Cælia</i>, Oh,
<i>Antonio</i>!<br>
Then lye him down again, and rest a space:<br>
Sometimes call <i>Jasper</i> to him, talk a while,<br>
And soon again rise in another Passion;<br>
Seldom I heard a word, except a Curse!<br>
Or now and then a Name; as <i>Lewis</i>, <i>Cælia</i>,<br>
<i>Pedro</i>, <i>Francisco</i>, <i>Flora</i>; nay, my Lord,<br>
Sometimes I heard your Name, and then <i>Eugenia&rsquo;s</i>;<br>
Then suddenly holding his hands to Heav&rsquo;n,<br>
He&rsquo;d down again, and there a while would role.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> These Actions sure did seem a perfect madness.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> It seem&rsquo;d indeed a madness methodiz&rsquo;d,<br>
Like theirs who are Transported far with Passion.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> But how perceiv&rsquo;d you <i>Jasper</i> bear himself?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Quite in another manner, but as strange!<br>
For when his Lord look&rsquo;d down, his looks would be<br>
As full of mirth, ready to burst in Laughter;<br>
That I perceiv&rsquo;d he scarce contain&rsquo;d himself:<br>
But if his Lord did look about to speak,<br>
Then was his Face demure, with hand on Breast,<br>
Turning his Eyes to Heav&rsquo;n, and groaning sighs.<br>
As you have seen, my Lord, a Canting Preacher<br>
Aiming to cheat his Audience, wanting matter,<br>
Sigh to seem Holy, till he thought on something.<br>
So at that distance seem&rsquo;d his Actions to me;<br>
But when his back was turn&rsquo;d, the Rascal would<br>
Make Mouths, and point with signs of greatest scorn.</p>

<p><i>Ger.</i> There is some Fatal Villany in this;<br>
Some Mystery beyond my Fathoming:<br>
But how long staid they thus?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> About two hours, when mounting both their Horses,<br>
I took mine, and un-espy&rsquo;d did dogg e&rsquo;m to the City,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
And where they Hous&rsquo;d I know not; for they enter&rsquo;d<br>

Who was my Aunt indeed, at your approach<br>

Nay, I&rsquo;d have him do&rsquo;t for his own safety,<br>

Thinking the Cuckold&rsquo;s Rage would murder all,<br>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
